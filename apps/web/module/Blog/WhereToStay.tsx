      <div>If you want to be in the heart of the entertainment, enjoy island hopping,
         restaurants and shops, we recommend you to stay at General Luna.
          You will find many offers on Booking</div>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-10 mb-2">Good Plan For Accommodation</h2>
      <div>We stayed in a quality Airbnb for 50â‚¬ per night. For the little story, we met the 
        manager by chance who is none other than my former roommate in Austria! The world is really small.
         For your comfort, we highly recommend this en-right for its good value for money. 
         We were really happy to find this more upscale accommodation for a few nights.</div>
