### 1. Install `Node.js`

We recommend you to use NVM, but if you already have the Node version that we need, that is fine. To install NVM simply go to this link [NVM Releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) and go to the latest release Assets and download `nvm-setup.exe` file then run and install it.

After you install NVM, run these commands in PowerShell

```
nvm install 20.10.0
```

```
nvm use 20.10.0
```

### 2. Clone the project

Make sure you have <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> installed in local machine then run this command in your PowerShell or any other Terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/explore-siargao/es-main.git
```

### 3. Setup TypeScript

Install `typescript` as a global dependency using this command

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### 4. Setup PNPM

```
npm install -g pnpm@8.14.1
```

### 5. Setup environment variables

Create `.env` file in the root of the project then ask the Admins for you to have the Environment Variables needed for the project.

### 6. Run setup command

Make sure that your current directory is `es-main` folder, then run this command

```
pnpm run install
```

This will install the dependencies and build the project

### 7. Run the project

You can now start your local development by running this command
